- 👋 Hey there! I'm Tarun Singh, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science student at Galaxy Global Group of Institutions, Dinarpur. My journey into the world of technology has equipped me with a diverse skill set,        including Python, Django, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and proficiency in MS Office tools like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

- 🚀 I love turning ideas into reality through coding. In my projects, I've dabbled in various domains, from web development to game design. For instance, I've crafted Bakerise, a sleek front-end website using HTML   and CSS. Additionally, I've delved into Python to create engaging projects like a replica of the iconic 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' game, a productive to-do list, and a water reminder app that promotes healthy habits.

- 💻 Recently, I've been diving deeper into Django, where I've developed a secure login/logout system integrated with a database. Currently, I'm channeling my enthusiasm into building a dynamic e-commerce website     that facilitates seamless user registration, login, and profile management.

- 🔗 Connect with me to explore my coding adventures and collaborate on exciting projects! Let's innovate together and leave a mark in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
